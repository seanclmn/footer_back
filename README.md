# Footer Back End


## Description

This project was started to allow football fans to follow their favorite teams by exploring the top leagues, and then adding teams to their personal dashboard. Users can also watch match highlights from recent games, as well as see upcoming fixtures and league data. The players section is still in production.

NOTE: the main web API being used (for standings and club info) has a call limit of 10 calls per minute.

Deployed App: https://footerfront.herokuapp.com/

## Technologies

This web application was built using the MERN (Mongodb Express React Node) stack. Two public APIs were used: Scorebat API and Football-Data API. For authorization, I used Auth0. Both the server and client were deployed via heroku.

## Original Wireframes

This was the original wireframe. During production, there were significant changes in the look of the header and the main container. Submit any issues to let me know what you think.
